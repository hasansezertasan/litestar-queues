Task events
===========

Task events tell applications and operators about a task's lifecycle, progress,
logs, or custom state. They are not the queue-backend notifications that wake
workers. Delivering an event does not help a worker find or claim a task, and
it does not store the queue record.

Enable publishing
=================

Provide Channels or one or more additive sinks:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar.channels.backends.memory import MemoryChannelsBackend

   from litestar_queues import QueueConfig
   from litestar_queues.events import EventDeliveryConfig, QueueEventsConfig

   channels_backend = MemoryChannelsBackend(history=100)

   queue_config = QueueConfig(
       events=QueueEventsConfig(
           channels=channels_backend,
           delivery=EventDeliveryConfig(publish_global_lifecycle=True),
       ),
   )

``MemoryChannelsBackend`` only reaches subscribers in the same process. Once the
worker and the web server are separate processes, swap it for a shared backend —
see `Topology and security`_.

History can be enabled without a live sink or Channels backend. With neither
history nor live delivery configured, publishing does nothing. By default, a
live-delivery failure does not fail the task. Set delivery ``strict=True``
when the caller must receive a sink error.

Publish from a task
===================

Choose the signal that matches what happened:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Signal
     - Meaning
     - Owner
   * - Heartbeat
     - Liveness timestamp used for recovery; ``beat(detail)`` may attach the
       latest short diagnostic detail.
     - The worker updates timestamps automatically while a task runs.
   * - Progress
     - Typed, measurable movement such as ``current`` out of ``total``.
     - Task code publishes it when meaningful work advances.
   * - Custom event
     - A distinct domain occurrence, such as ``crawl.page_discovered``.
     - Task code publishes it when that occurrence happens.
   * - Lifecycle event
     - A queue-owned state transition such as ``task.started``,
       ``task.completed``, or ``task.failed``.
     - The service and worker publish it automatically.

Tasks do not need to call ``beat()`` to remain alive, and a progress update
should not also be copied into a generic custom event. Use ``beat(detail)``
only when a short, last-value diagnostic helps recovery or operations.

The context methods make those boundaries explicit:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar_queues import task
   from litestar_queues.events import TaskExecutionContext


   @task("crawl.run", timeout=300)
   async def crawl(*, _task_context: TaskExecutionContext) -> dict[str, int]:
       ctx = _task_context

       # Standardized progress state for status pages and UI consumers.
       await ctx.progress(
           current=3,
           total=6,
           message="3/6 pages",
           payload={"page": 3},
       )

       # An application occurrence; it does not update progress or terminal
       # task state. False keeps ordinary events eligible for buffering.
       await ctx.event(
           "crawl.page_discovered",
           message="Discovered the queue guide",
           payload={"url": "https://example.invalid/queues"},
           immediate=False,
       )

       # Optional last-value diagnostic for the next automatic heartbeat.
       ctx.beat("Parsing the final page")
       return {"pages": 6}

``ctx.progress(current=..., total=..., message=..., payload=...)`` publishes
``task.progress`` and derives a percentage when ``current`` and ``total`` are
available. ``ctx.event(name, message=..., payload=..., immediate=False)``
publishes the supplied application event name. A custom event does not update
progress or terminal task state. Set ``immediate=True`` only when that event
must bypass the ordinary live-event buffer.

Automatic worker heartbeats keep active jobs live. ``ctx.beat(detail)`` is an
optional, last-value-wins detail update for the next heartbeat write; it is not
a liveness requirement and does not publish a task event by itself.

The active task context adds the task ID, task name, queue, worker ID, attempt,
execution backend, and sequence. All publish helpers also accept ``scope``,
``scope_key``, ``entity``, and ``stage`` to attach domain grouping and
lifecycle dimensions.

A running task never has to bind that context. The service binds it before it
calls the task body, so the module-level helpers resolve it on their own:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar_queues import task
   from litestar_queues.events import publish_task_progress


   @task("catalog.import")
   async def import_catalog() -> None:
       await publish_task_progress(current=13, total=400)

Each helper is a pass-through to the context method of the same name, so
``publish_task_progress(...)`` and ``ctx.progress(...)`` do the same work.
Prefer the context method in a task body, where the context is already in hand.
Reach for a helper in a function further down the call stack, so it can report
progress without threading ``ctx`` through every signature in between. A helper
raises :exc:`RuntimeError` when no context is bound.

Context injection is keyed on the parameter **name** ``_task_context``, not on
its type annotation: a parameter annotated ``TaskExecutionContext`` under any
other name receives nothing. A task declaring ``**kwargs`` also receives the
context under that key.

Keep payloads small and JSON-serializable. Put large files, crawled documents,
and model artifacts in external storage and send a stable reference in the
payload.

Buffering and external producers
================================

When enabled, history commits before live delivery. Publication snapshots the
event, so later mutation of its payload cannot change accepted history or live
delivery. Ordinary publication may return after bounded acceptance. A terminal
or immediate event, explicit flush, and clean close attempt a history barrier;
a non-strict write failure retains the event and withholds its live delivery.
See :doc:`event-history` for capacity, retry and shutdown behavior.

Non-terminal live events are sent in small batches. A final event follows the
earlier live batch, including a batch already being delivered. Sinks with
``publish_many`` receive a batch; other sinks receive the events one at a time
in order. A sink failure does not replay committed history.

Sink callbacks may publish more events. If such a callback fills a live buffer
configured with blocking overflow, admission raises ``QueueEventBufferFull``
instead of waiting on the callback's own drain. During a history or live-buffer
drain, open or close services and external producers outside the event callback;
lifecycle calls from that callback raise ``QueueConfigurationError`` before
changing ownership.

Retries may produce another ``task.started`` for the same task ID.
``task.failed`` includes ``will_retry`` so a consumer can distinguish an
attempt failure from a terminal failure. Cancellation, claim loss, and stale
failure are separate terminal paths; consumers should not infer persisted
result data from the event payload alone. After any terminal event, refresh the
:class:`~litestar_queues.TaskResult` when the record, result, or error is
needed.

Returning normally stores the return value and publishes ``task.completed``.
Raising follows the task's retry policy: ``task.failed`` reports
``will_retry=true`` when the record was requeued, and a later attempt publishes
another ``task.started``. With no retry remaining, the record and event are
terminally failed. Task code should not publish its own completed or failed
lifecycle event.

Code outside a worker should use this context manager. It takes the same
``queue_config`` built under `Enable publishing`_:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar_queues.events import create_event_producer


   async def report_started(task_id: str) -> None:
       async with create_event_producer(queue_config) as events:
           await events.task(task_id).progress(current=1, total=2, message="Started")

The context manager opens its delivery resources, flushes pending live events,
and attempts every acquired resource's cleanup. It does not provision backend
history. ``QueueEventProducer`` does not manage resources by itself; see
:doc:`events-standalone` for acquisition and failure behavior.

.. _live-delivery-vs-history:

Live delivery versus durable history
====================================

Live streams deliver events; they do not store them. A subscriber receives only
what is published while it is connected, so a client that connects late,
reconnects, or falls behind the Channels backlog misses the rest. Keepalives
keep an idle connection open; they do not prove a task is healthy.

Durable history answers "what happened?" after the fact; live delivery answers
"what is happening now?" A deployment may use either or both. Replaying history
into a newly connected client is an application policy — a live Channels backend
does not read the queue event log.

Enable and query history with :doc:`event-history`.

Using events without the queue
==============================

The ``litestar_queues.events`` subpackage also runs on its own, for a runtime
that has its own task runner and never starts this package's worker. That is a
separate integration path with its own setup — see
:doc:`events-standalone`. Nothing on this page requires it.

Topology and security
=====================

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Example topology
     - Live delivery
     - Boundary
   * - Memory WebSocket/SSE
     - Same-process ``MemoryChannelsBackend``
     - Local demo; web and worker stay together.
   * - Separate Redis/Valkey worker
     - Explicit shared Channels backend
     - Use separate queue/Channels prefixes and authenticated services.
   * - Multiple web replicas
     - Broadcast-capable shared Channels transport
     - Authorize task/queue/worker/custom scope subscriptions.

SQLSpec durable table queues are shared work queues: one consumer claims each
record. They are not broadcast delivery for multiple browser-serving processes.

Next steps
==========

* :doc:`event-streams` exposes SSE and WebSocket endpoints.
* :doc:`event-history` retains and queries backend-managed history.
* :doc:`event-testing` tests delivery without external infrastructure.
* :doc:`../examples/index` runs the canonical visual examples.
