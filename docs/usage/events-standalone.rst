Events without the queue
==========================

.. note::

   This page is only for runtimes that never run this package's worker. If you
   enqueue work with ``@task`` and a queue backend, none of this applies:
   publishing is the one-line call in :doc:`events`, and the service binds a
   context for you before it calls your task body. Constructing a
   ``TaskExecutionContext`` by hand there would shadow the real one.

``litestar_queues.events`` works on its own. It needs only ``litestar`` and
``typing_extensions``: no queue backend, no worker, and no queue record. A
runtime that already has its own task runner can bind a task context and use
the same event surface the package's own worker uses, rather than reimplementing
the envelope, the sinks, and the chunking.

Binding a task context
======================

``bind_task_context()`` binds a :class:`~litestar_queues.events.TaskExecutionContext`
for the duration of a ``with`` block. While it is bound,
``get_current_task_context()`` and the module-level publish helpers resolve to
it. Setting a context variable is synchronous, so one plain ``with`` block works
inside both sync and async task bodies:

.. code-block:: python

   import asyncio

   from litestar_queues.events import (
       InMemoryQueueEventSink,
       QueueEventPublisher,
       TaskExecutionContext,
       bind_task_context,
   )


   async def main() -> None:
       sink = InMemoryQueueEventSink()
       publisher = QueueEventPublisher(sink)
       context = TaskExecutionContext(
           task_id="import-42",
           task_name="catalog.import",
           queue="default",
           worker_id="runner-1",
           execution_backend="external",
           execution_profile=None,
           attempt=1,
           event_publisher=publisher,
       )

       with bind_task_context(context) as ctx:
           await ctx.progress(current=12, total=400, message="loading")

       print([event.type for event in sink.events])


   asyncio.run(main())

Receiving beats
===============

``bind_beat_sink()`` binds the receiver for ``ctx.beat(detail)``, the optional
last-value-wins diagnostic detail. Implement
:class:`~litestar_queues.events.TaskBeatSink` to receive it:

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar_queues.events import TaskBeatSink, bind_beat_sink


   class LastBeat(TaskBeatSink):
       def __init__(self) -> None:
           self.detail: str | None = None

       def record_beat(self, task_id: str, detail: str | None) -> None:
           self.detail = detail


   beats = LastBeat()
   with bind_task_context(context), bind_beat_sink(beats):
       context.beat("row 30000")

Actor attachment
================

Attach a :class:`~litestar_queues.events.QueueEventActor` to identify who or what
triggered the work. When a history provider is attached, it stores the actor's
type and ID. Filter with ``query_events(query, extra={"actor_id": "usr_123"})``
or ``actor_type``; ``QueueEventQuery`` has no typed actor parameter. A standalone
delivery producer does not create a queue backend or history provider.

There are three ways to attach an actor, evaluated in precedence order:

1. **Per-call override:** Pass ``actor=QueueEventActor(...)`` directly to
   ``ctx.publish()``, ``ctx.progress()``, ``ctx.log()``, ``ctx.event()``, or module helpers like
   ``publish_task_log(..., actor=...)``.
2. **Context actor:** Set ``context.actor = QueueEventActor(...)`` on the active
   :class:`~litestar_queues.events.TaskExecutionContext`. All events published under the context
   inherit this actor unless overridden per-call.
3. **Decorator declaration:** When using queue tasks, declare ``@task(actor=...)`` with a
   literal :class:`~litestar_queues.events.QueueEventActor` or zero-arg callable resolver.

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar_queues.events import (
       QueueEventActor,
       publish_task_log,
       publish_task_progress,
   )

   # Explicit context actor
   context.actor = QueueEventActor(type="service", id="cron-sync")

   # Inherits context actor ("service", "cron-sync")
   await publish_task_log("Starting sync")

   # Per-call override for a specific sub-action
   await publish_task_progress(
       current=10,
       total=100,
       actor=QueueEventActor(type="user", id="usr_123"),
   )

Producer resource ownership
===========================

Use ``async with create_event_producer(queue_config)`` when this integration
owns its delivery resources. Each distinct resource is acquired once by object
identity, even when it appears in several delivery positions. Delivery itself
still follows the configured fan-out.

If startup fails, the context manager unwinds resources whose startup completed,
in reverse order. A resource whose own startup fails is responsible for its
partial acquisition. Cleanup attempts the live-buffer stop and every acquired
resource's close, even if an earlier cleanup raises. Repeated close is harmless.

An exception or cancellation from the body or startup remains the primary
error; secondary cleanup failures are logged. Without a primary error, cleanup
failure propagates, with cancellation taking precedence over ordinary errors.
Do not open or close the producer from a callback draining its live buffer;
finish that callback first. The context manager owns live delivery only, so
configure and close any separate history provider through its own owner.

Cancellation
============

Durable cancellation fan-in stays internal: the package's own worker binds it
when it owns the queue record. An external runtime cancels through its own
mechanism and can still surface that to task code by calling
``context.mark_cancelled()``.

For durable, queryable history see :doc:`event-history`, and
:doc:`event-history-extending` for scoping it by a dimension the queue does not
model, such as a tenant or project id.
