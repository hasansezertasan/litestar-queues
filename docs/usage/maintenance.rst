=================
Queue maintenance
=================

``litestar queues run-maintenance`` performs a small, predictable amount of
repair and retention work and then exits. It is designed for an **infrequent
external schedule** — a six-hour or daily cron — and is deliberately finite:
it never starts a worker, never executes queued work, and never loops to drain
a backlog. The package does not create cron records, enqueue a hidden
maintenance task, or persist a due-state.

Maintenance is not a worker or a scheduler
==========================================

* A :doc:`worker <workers>` claims and executes due tasks continuously.
* The :doc:`scheduler <schedules>` promotes recurring task definitions into due
  records.
* **Maintenance** repairs and prunes existing records once and exits. It does
  not dispatch ordinary queued work.

Phases
======

Every invocation runs the configured phases once, in this fixed order:

#. **external** — repair missing deliveries, then reconcile dispatched records against their
   execution backend. Enabled only for external execution backends (skipped for
   immediate/local execution).
#. **stale** — recover running tasks whose heartbeats are stale. Enabled when
   ``stale_after`` is set.
#. **terminal** — delete terminal (completed/failed/cancelled/expired) records
   older than ``terminal_retention``. Enabled when ``terminal_retention`` is
   set.
#. **events** — delete durable event-history rows older than
   ``event_retention_rules``. Enabled when ``event_retention_rules`` is set *and* a durable
   event log is configured; otherwise the phase is skipped, not an error.

Each phase performs **at most one bounded batch** per invocation. Retention
cutoffs are computed once, at the start of the run, so every phase in a single
invocation uses a stable boundary.

If a phase fails, its result contains a package-owned error code and exception
type, later phases still run while time remains, and the whole invocation exits
``1``. Exception messages, connection strings, credentials, and task payloads
are not included in the summary.

Configuration
=============

Maintenance thresholds live on :attr:`QueueConfig.maintenance`. There are **no
destructive defaults**: stale recovery and both retention phases stay disabled
until you supply their thresholds.

.. code-block:: python

   from litestar_queues import QueueConfig, QueueMaintenanceConfig

   config = QueueConfig(
       queue_backend=...,  # a persistent backend
       maintenance=QueueMaintenanceConfig(
           time_budget=300.0,          # seconds; bounds one whole invocation
           coordination_timeout=360.0, # seconds; must exceed time_budget
           external_limit=100,         # max external records examined per run
           stale_after=900.0,          # recover heartbeats older than 15 minutes
           stale_limit=100,            # max stale records recovered per run
           terminal_retention=None,    # None disables terminal cleanup
           terminal_limit=1000,        # max terminal records deleted per run
           event_retention_rules=(),       # None disables event-history cleanup
           event_limit=1000,           # max event rows deleted per run
       ),
   )

Durations and retention windows are seconds; every limit and duration must be
positive. ``coordination_timeout`` must be greater than ``time_budget`` because
ownership is not renewed during a run. Leaving
``stale_after``, ``terminal_retention``, or ``event_retention_rules`` as ``None``
disables that phase.

Bounded batches and the time budget
===================================

Each phase uses its configured limit (``external_limit``, ``stale_limit``,
``terminal_limit``, ``event_limit``), and the service checks the wall-clock
``time_budget`` between phases. When the budget
is exhausted, the remaining enabled phases are reported ``partial`` and no
further backend operation starts. The budget does not interrupt a phase already
in progress. Keep the schedule frequent enough that new work does not outpace
one batch, or raise the limits.

For Cloud Tasks, the external limit bounds records **examined**, shared between
delivery repair and subsequent reconciliation. Repair selects unexpired pending
or scheduled records, including future schedules and records without a delivery
reference. It orders by the last persisted ``dispatch_checked_at`` (falling back
to ``created_at``), then record ID, and advances the check timestamp before
returning candidates. Repeated passes therefore revisit the least recently
checked records, including after a process restart. Stale index entries consume
the scan budget; the pass does not refill its page by scanning the backlog.

Repair results expose ``examined``, ``changed``, ``failed``, ``unchanged``, and
``limit_reached``. A full scan budget conservatively reports ``partial``; it
does not prove more records remain. A repair failure reports ``failed`` with
``maintenance_repair_failed``, preserving successful changes from that same
pass. Failure takes precedence over a partial result.

For programmatic use, ``QueueService.reconcile_external_result(limit=100)``
returns an ``ExternalReconciliationResult`` containing ``repair`` and
``reconciled``; its ``changed`` includes both. A zero limit returns deferred
work (``repair.limit_reached=True``) without querying storage or the provider.
The older ``reconcile_external(limit=100)`` returns an integer on success and
raises ``QueueDispatchRepairError`` carrying that structured ``result`` if
repair fails. Calling it without a limit retains reconciliation-only behavior;
it does not run delivery repair.

Distributed coordination
========================

Before running, the service acquires token-fenced ownership of the
``queue-maintenance`` operation on the queue backend. If another process already
owns it, this invocation is a **successful no-op** (outcome ``already_running``,
exit ``0``) so an overlapping scheduled run does not retry into the active one.
Ownership is released in a ``finally`` block. Token checking prevents a stale
holder from removing a successor's ownership record.

A backend call that hangs past ``coordination_timeout`` is outside the guarantee, but every
bounded mutation is idempotent or conditionally updates current persisted state.
The next scheduled invocation can therefore resume any remaining work. Keep
``coordination_timeout`` comfortably above the expected runtime as well as above the
configured budget.

Command and exit codes
======================

.. code-block:: console

   $ litestar queues run-maintenance
   outcome: completed
   acquired: True
   duration_ms: 41.2
   Phase     Status        Changed  Duration(ms)  Error
   ---------------------------------------------------
   external  skipped             0           0.0  -
   stale     completed           4           9.1  -
   terminal  completed          18          21.4  -
   events    skipped             0           0.0  -

``--phase [external|stale|terminal|events]`` (repeatable) narrows the run;
filtering only narrows configuration and never enables a disabled retention
threshold. ``--json`` emits one compact object matching
:class:`~litestar_queues.QueueMaintenanceSummary`. The output includes the
outcome, ownership state, duration, and one result per selected phase, and never
includes task payloads.

When repair runs, text output includes its counts and JSON includes them under
the external phase's ``repair`` object. A positive ``changed`` count does not
make a phase successful if its ``failed`` count is also positive.

============  ==================================================================
Code          Meaning
============  ==================================================================
``0``         Completed, a clean no-op, or maintenance was already running.
``1``         Configuration error, lifecycle failure, or a phase failed.
``2``         Partial: time budget exhausted or the repair scan limit reached.

A separate CLI process cannot see in-memory records.
:class:`~litestar_queues.QueueMaintenanceService` still supports memory for
tests and same-process applications.

Provision SQL maintenance tables before scheduling the command:

* **SQLSpec** — run the application's normal migrations, including the packaged
  ``0001_create_queue_tasks`` and ``0002_add_dispatch_checked_at`` migrations.
  See :doc:`backends/sqlspec` for custom tables and Spanner native DDL.
  Override the table name with
  ``SQLSpecBackendConfig.maintenance_table_name``.
* **Advanced Alchemy** — include ``QueueMaintenanceModel`` in application
  metadata, or compose
  :class:`~litestar_queues.backends.advanced_alchemy.QueueMaintenanceModelMixin`
  into an application model and pass it as
  ``SQLAlchemyBackendConfig.maintenance_model_class``. Create the table
  with the same Alembic or ``create_all`` workflow that owns the queue model;
  the queue backend never creates it.
  Existing task tables also need the timestamp and repair index described in
  :doc:`backends/advanced-alchemy`.

A missing maintenance table fails closed instead of falling back to a process-local
lock.

Scheduling recipe
=================

Run maintenance from **one** external scheduler on an infrequent cadence.
The same finite command runs from Cloud Run, a Kubernetes ``CronJob``, a
``systemd`` timer, or a shell. Do **not** create four per-phase schedules or run
maintenance at minute-level cadence.

Recommended: one six-hour cron (``0 */6 * * *``, roughly 120 invocations over 30
days). A low-volume alternative is once daily (``0 3 * * *``).

Kubernetes cron job
-------------------

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: CronJob
   metadata:
     name: queue-maintenance
   spec:
     schedule: "0 */6 * * *"  # every six hours
     concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
     jobTemplate:
       spec:
         template:
           spec:
             restartPolicy: Never
             containers:
               - name: maintain
                 image: your-app-image
                 command: ["litestar", "queues", "run-maintenance"]
                 env:
                   - name: LITESTAR_APP
                     value: app.asgi:app

systemd timer
-------------

.. code-block:: ini

   # queue-maintenance.timer
   [Timer]
   OnCalendar=*-*-* 00/6:00:00
   Persistent=true

   # queue-maintenance.service
   [Service]
   Type=oneshot
   Environment=LITESTAR_APP=app.asgi:app
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/litestar queues run-maintenance

Cloud Run job invoked by Cloud Scheduler
----------------------------------------

Deploy the command as a Cloud Run **Job** and trigger it from Cloud Scheduler on
the same six-hour cron. Cloud Run is not part of the core design — it is one
launch surface among many. A Job launched this way runs exactly the same finite
repair and retention pass as any other host, and still does not dispatch
ordinary queued work.

.. code-block:: console

   $ gcloud run jobs create queue-maintenance \
       --image your-app-image \
       --region CLOUD_RUN_REGION \
       --command litestar --args queues,run-maintenance \
       --set-env-vars LITESTAR_APP=app.asgi:app

   $ gcloud scheduler jobs create http queue-maintenance \
       --location SCHEDULER_REGION \
       --schedule "0 */6 * * *" \
       --uri "https://run.googleapis.com/v2/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/CLOUD_RUN_REGION/jobs/queue-maintenance:run" \
       --http-method POST \
       --oauth-service-account-email SCHEDULER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT

Grant the scheduler service account the Cloud Run Invoker role on the job.
Google's `scheduled jobs guide <https://docs.cloud.google.com/run/docs/execute/jobs-on-schedule>`_
lists the required roles and current command shape.
