"""Cloud Tasks execution backend.

Constructing the backend never builds a Google client: the client is resolved on
first use so an installation without the ``cloud-tasks`` extra can still import,
configure, and validate this backend.

Scheduling only ever runs against an already-durable record, and the delivery's
resource name is persisted before the create call so an ambiguous response still
leaves a handle to look the delivery up by.
